<p>On September 5, 2007, the account by the name "taia777" was created.</p>
<p>It took until April 26, 2012 for taia777 to upload his first video.</p>
<p>This video has the title とげとげタルめいろ"スーパードンキーコング2", which translates as Stickerbrush Symphony "Donkey Kong Country 2". </p>
<p>The video consists of the music track on the title, along with a pixelated image of vines on a slowly scrolling background of clouds.</p>
<p>This page's background is a loop of the video, and the background music (see top right) is the same music track.</p>
<hr>
<p>It wasn't until mid-late 2019 when the video gained popularity. The youtube recommended AI recommended this video to many different users. The video gained a lot of views, possible due to the mysterious nature of the video. Who wouldn't click on a with a Japanese title and a strange thumbnail?</p>
<p>Of course, this video garnered a lot of comments about how this video is the end of the internet and others, but the most interesting thing about the comments are the checkpoints.</p>
<p>Somehow, people in the comments started commenting a short tale about their recent life, as if to save their progress, or as if they hit a checkpoint. As some people started to do these checkpoints, other people followed.</p>
<p>These short stories give a glimpse into the pains of others, and are honestly just an interesting read.</p>
<p>The video continues to grow popularity as Youtube continues to recommend this video to others.</p>
<hr>
<p>Despite this video containing most of the internet checkpoints, not all of the comments on this video are checkpoints.</p>
<p>There are many comments commenting on the music, as well as comments complaining about the checkpoints on this video.
<p>Comments in languages other than English also appear on this video, these usually seem to be in Japanese or in Portuguese</p>
<hr>
<p>As for the creator, taia777, he eventually uploaded 28 separate videos, all of which are extended songs from assorted, mostly Nintendo, video games. Most, if not all, of these videos have similar scrolling backgrounds behind them.</p>
<p>taia777's last video was published on September 1, 2017, and he has not been seen since.</p>
<p>What happened to this person? Who even is this person? These are questions we probably cannot ever answer, but at least we have the videos he provided, and the checkpoints left behind on them.</p>
